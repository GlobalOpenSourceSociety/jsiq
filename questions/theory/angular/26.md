### What are template statements?

A template statement responds to an event raised by a binding target such as an element, component, or directive. The template statements appear in quotes to the right of the = symbol like **(event)="statement"**.

Let's take an example of button click event's statement

```html
<button (click)="editProfile()">Edit Profile</button>
```

In the above expression, editProfile is a template statement. The below JavaScript syntax expressions are not allowed.

1. new
2. increment and decrement operators, ++ and --
3. operator assignment, such as += and -=
4. the bitwise operators | and &
5. the template expression operators
