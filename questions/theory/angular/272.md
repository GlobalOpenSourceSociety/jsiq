### What is Component Test Harnesses?

A component harness is a testing API around an Angular directive or component to make tests simpler by hiding implementation details from test suites. This can be shared between unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. The idea for component harnesses comes from the **PageObject** pattern commonly used for integration testing.
