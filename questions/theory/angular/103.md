# What is State function?

Angular's state() function is used to define different states to call at the end of each transition. This function takes two arguments: a unique name like open or closed and a style() function.

For example, you can write a open state function

```javascript
state('open', style({
  height: '300px',
  opacity: 0.5,
  backgroundColor: 'blue'
})),
```
