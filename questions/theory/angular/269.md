# How to set ngFor and ngIf on the same element?

Sometimes you may need to both ngFor and ngIf on the same element but unfortunately you are going to encounter below template error.

```cmd
Template parse errors: Can't have multiple template bindings on one element.
```

In this case, You need to use either ng-container or ng-template. Let's say if you try to loop over the items only when the items are available, the below code throws an error in the browser

```html
<ul *ngIf="items" *ngFor="let item of items">
  <li></li>
</ul>
```

and it can be fixed by

```html
<ng-container *ngIf="items">
  <ul *ngFor="let item of items">
    <li></li>
  </ul>
</ng-container>
```
