# How do you restrict provider scope to a module?

It is possible to restrict service provider scope to a specific module instead making available to entire application. There are two possible ways to do it.

1. **Using providedIn in service:**

   ```js
   import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
   import { SomeModule } from './some.module';

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: SomeModule,
   })
   export class SomeService {}
   ```

2. **Declare provider for the service in module:**

   ```js
   import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

   import { SomeService } from './some.service';

   @NgModule({
     providers: [SomeService],
   })
   export class SomeModule {}
   ```
