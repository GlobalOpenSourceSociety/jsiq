# What is an observable?

An Observable is a unique Object similar to a Promise that can help manage async code. Observables are not part of the JavaScript language so we need to rely on a popular Observable library called RxJS. The observables are created using new keyword.

Let see the simple example of observable,

```javascript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

const observable = new Observable((observer) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    observer.next('Hello from a Observable!');
  }, 2000);
});
```
