### How do you run Bazel directly?

Sometimes you may want to bypass the Angular CLI builder and run Bazel directly using Bazel CLI. You can install it globally using @bazel/bazel npm package. i.e, Bazel CLI is available under @bazel/bazel package. After you can apply the below common commands,

```javascrippt
bazel build [targets] // Compile the default output artifacts of the given targets.
bazel test [targets] // Run the tests with *_test targets found in the pattern.
bazel run [target]: Compile the program represented by target and then run it.
```
