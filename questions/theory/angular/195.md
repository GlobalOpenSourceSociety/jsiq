# How do you create schematics for libraries?

You can create your own schematic collections to integrate your library with the Angular CLI. These collections are classified as 3 main schematics,

1. **Add schematics:** These schematics are used to install library in an Angular workspace using `ng add` command. For example, @angular/material schematic tells the add command to install and set up Angular Material and theming.
2. **Generate schematics**: These schematics are used to modify projects, add configurations and scripts, and scaffold artifacts in library using `ng generate` command. For example, @angular/material generation schematic supplies generation schematics for the UI components. Let's say the table component is generated using `ng generate @angular/material:table `.
3. **Update schematics:** These schematics are used to update library's dependencies and adjust for breaking changes in a new library release using `ng update` command. For example, @angular/material update schematic updates material and cdk dependencies using `ng update @angular/material` command.
