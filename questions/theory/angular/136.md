### What is platform in Angular?

A platform is the context in which an Angular application runs. The most common platform for Angular applications is a web browser, but it can also be an operating system for a mobile device, or a web server. The runtime-platform is provided by the @angular/platform-\* packages and these packages allow applications that make use of `@angular/core` and `@angular/common` to execute in different environments. i.e, Angular can be used as platform-independent framework in different environments, For example,

1. While running in the browser, it uses `platform-browser` package.
2. When SSR(server-side rendering ) is used, it uses `platform-server` package for providing web server implementation.
