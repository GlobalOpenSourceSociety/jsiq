### How do you provide build configuration for multiple locales?

You can provide build configuration such as translation file path, name, format and application url in `configuration` settings of Angular.json file. For example, the German version of your application configured the build as follows,

```javascript
"configurations": {
  "de": {
    "aot": true,
    "outputPath": "dist/my-project-de/",
    "baseHref": "/fr/",
    "i18nFile": "src/locale/messages.de.xlf",
    "i18nFormat": "xlf",
    "i18nLocale": "de",
    "i18nMissingTranslation": "error",
  }
```
