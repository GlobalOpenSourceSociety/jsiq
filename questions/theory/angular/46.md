### How do you perform error handling in observables?

You can handle errors by specifying an **error callback** on the observer instead of relying on try/catch which are ineffective in asynchronous environment.

For example, you can define error callback as below,

```javascript
myObservable.subscribe({
  next(num) {
    console.log('Next num: ' + num);
  },
  error(err) {
    console.log('Received an errror: ' + err);
  },
});
```
