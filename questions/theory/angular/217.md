# What is a routed entry component?

The components referenced in router configuration are called as routed entry components. This routed entry component defined in a route definition as below,

```js
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: TodoListComponent, // router entry component
  },
];
```

Since router definition requires you to add the component in two places (router and entryComponents), these components are always entry components.

**Note:** The compilers are smart enough to recognize a router definition and automatically add the router component into `entryComponents`.
