# What is transition function?

The animation transition function is used to specify the changes that occur between one state and another over a period of time. It accepts two arguments: the first argument accepts an expression that defines the direction between two transition states, and the second argument accepts an animate() function.

Let's take an example state transition from open to closed with an half second transition between states.

```javascript
transition('open => closed', [
  animate('500ms')
]),
```
