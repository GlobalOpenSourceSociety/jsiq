# What are the advantages with AOT?

Below are the list of AOT benefits,

1. **Faster rendering:** The browser downloads a pre-compiled version of the application. So it can render the application immediately without compiling the app.
2. **Fewer asynchronous requests:** It inlines external HTML templates and CSS style sheets within the application javascript which eliminates separate ajax requests.
3. **Smaller Angular framework download size:** Doesn't require downloading the Angular compiler. Hence it dramatically reduces the application payload.
4. **Detect template errors earlier:** Detects and reports template binding errors during the build step itself
5. **Better security:** It compiles HTML templates and components into JavaScript. So there won't be any injection attacks.
