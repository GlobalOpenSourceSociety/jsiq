# Is Angular supports dynamic imports?

Yes, Angular 8 supports dynamic imports in router configuration. i.e, You can use the import statement for lazy loading the module using `loadChildren` method and it will be understood by the IDEs(VSCode and WebStorm), webpack, etc. Previously, you have been written as below to lazily load the feature module. By mistake, if you have typo in the module name it still accepts the string and throws an error during build time.

```javascript
{path: ‘user’, loadChildren: ‘./users/user.module#UserModulee’},
```

This problem is resolved by using dynamic imports and IDEs are able to find it during compile time itself.

```javascript
{path: ‘user’, loadChildren: () => import(‘./users/user.module’).then(m => m.UserModule)};
```
