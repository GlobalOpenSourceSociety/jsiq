### What are the various security contexts in Angular?

Angular defines the following security contexts for sanitization,

1. **HTML:** It is used when interpreting a value as HTML such as binding to innerHtml.
2. **Style:** It is used when binding CSS into the style property.
3. **URL:** It is used for URL properties such as `<a href>`.
4. **Resource URL:** It is a URL that will be loaded and executed as code such as `<script src>`.
