# What is an observer?

Observer is an interface for a consumer of push-based notifications delivered by an Observable. It has below structure,

```javascript
interface Observer<T> {
  closed?: boolean;
  next: (value: T) => void;
  error: (err: any) => void;
  complete: () => void;
}
```

A handler that implements the Observer interface for receiving observable notifications will be passed as a parameter for observable as below,

```javascript
myObservable.subscribe(myObserver);
```

**Note:** If you don't supply a handler for a notification type, the observer ignores notifications of that type.
