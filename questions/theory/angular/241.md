### What is ngcc?

The ngcc(Angular Compatibility Compiler) is a tool which upgrades node_module compiled with non-ivy ngc into ivy compliant format. The `postinstall` script from package.json will make sure your node_modules will be compatible with the Ivy renderer.

```js
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "ngcc"
}
```

Whereas, Ivy compiler (ngtsc), which compiles Ivy-compatible code.
