# How do you update specific properties of a form model?

You can use `patchValue()` method to update specific properties defined in the form model. For example,you can update the name and street of certain profile on click of the update button as shown below.

```js
updateProfile() {
  this.userProfile.patchValue({
    firstName: 'John',
    address: {
      street: '98 Crescent Street'
    }
  });
}
```

```html
<button (click)="updateProfile()">Update Profile</button>
```

You can also use `setValue` method to update properties.

**Note:** Remember to update the properties against the exact model structure.
