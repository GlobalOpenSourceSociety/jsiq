# What are the imported modules in CLI generated feature modules?

In the CLI generated feature module, there are two JavaScript import statements at the top of the file

1. **NgModule:** InOrder to use the `@NgModule` decorator
2. **CommonModule:** It provides many common directives such as `ngIf` and `ngFor`.
