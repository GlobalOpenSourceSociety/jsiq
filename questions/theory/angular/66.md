### What is router outlet?

The RouterOutlet is a directive from the router library and it acts as a placeholder that marks the spot in the template where the router should display the components for that outlet. Router outlet is used like a component,

```html
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<!-- Routed components go here -->
```
