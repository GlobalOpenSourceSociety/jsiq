# What happens if you use script tag inside template?

Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it, which removes the `script` tag but keeps safe content such as the text content of the `script` tag. This way it eliminates the risk of script injection attacks. If you still use it then it will be ignored and a warning appears in the browser console.

Let's take an example of innerHtml property binding which causes XSS vulnerability,

```typescript
export class InnerHtmlBindingComponent {
  // For example, a user/attacker-controlled value from a URL.
  htmlSnippet = 'Template <script>alert("0wned")</script> <b>Syntax</b>';
}
```
