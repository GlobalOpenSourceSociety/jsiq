# How do you categorize data binding types?

Binding types can be grouped into three categories distinguished by the direction of data flow. They are listed as below,

1. From the source-to-view
2. From view-to-source
3. View-to-source-to-view

The possible binding syntax can be tabularized as below,

| Data direction | Syntax | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| From the source-to-view(One-way) | 1. {{expression}} 2. [target]="expression" 3. bind-target="expression" | Interpolation, Property, Attribute, Class, Style |
| From view-to-source(One-way) | 1. (target)="statement" 2. on-target="statement" | Event |
| View-to-source-to-view(Two-way) | 1. [(target)]="expression" 2. bindon-target="expression" | Two-way |
