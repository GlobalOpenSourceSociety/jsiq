# How can I use SASS in angular project?

When you are creating your project with angular cli, you can use `ng new`command. It generates all your components with predefined sass files.

```javascript
ng new My_New_Project --style=sass
```

But if you are changing your existing style in your project then use `ng set` command,

```javascript
ng set defaults.styleExt scss
```
