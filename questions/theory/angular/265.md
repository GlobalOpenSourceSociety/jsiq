# How do you reset the form?

In a model-driven form, you can reset the form just by calling the function `reset()` on our form model. For example, you can reset the form model on submission as follows,

```js
onSubmit() {
  if (this.myform.valid) {
    console.log("Form is submitted");
    // Perform business logic here
    this.myform.reset();
  }
}
```

Now, your form model resets the form back to its original pristine state.
