### What is a builder?

A builder function ia a function that uses the `Architect API` to perform a complex process such as "build" or "test". The builder code is defined in an npm package. For example, BrowserBuilder runs a webpack build for a browser target and KarmaBuilder starts the Karma server and runs a webpack build for unit tests.
