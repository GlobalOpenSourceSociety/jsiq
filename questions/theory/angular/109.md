### What are the design goals of service workers?

Below are the list of design goals of Angular's service workers,

1. It caches an application just like installing a native application
2. A running application continues to run with the same version of all files without any incompatible files
3. When you refresh the application, it loads the latest fully cached version
4. When changes are published then it immediately updates in the background
5. Service workers saves the bandwidth by downloading the resources only when they changed.
