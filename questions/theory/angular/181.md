### What is the purpose of custom id?

When you change the translatable text, the Angular extractor tool generates a new id for that translation unit. Because of this behavior, you must then update the translation file with the new id every time.

For example, the translation file `messages.de.xlf.html` has generated trans-unit for some text message as below

```html
<trans-unit id="827wwe104d3d69bf669f823jjde888" datatype="html"></trans-unit>
```

You can avoid this manual update of `id` attribute by specifying a custom id in the i18n attribute by using the prefix @@.

```javascript
<h1 i18n="@@welcomeHeader">Hello i18n!</h1>
```
