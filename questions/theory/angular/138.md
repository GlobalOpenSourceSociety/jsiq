# How do you select an element with in a component template?

You can use `@ViewChild` directive to access elements in the view directly. Let's take input element with a reference,

```html
<input #uname />
```

and define view child directive and access it in ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hook

```javascript
@ViewChild('uname') input;

ngAfterViewInit() {
  console.log(this.input.nativeElement.value);
}
```
