# How do you upgrade location service of angularjs?

If you are using `$location` service in your old AngularJS application, now you can use `LocationUpgradeModule`(unified location service) which puts the responsibilities of `$location` service to `Location` service in Angular. Let's add this module to `AppModule` as below,

```javascript
// Other imports ...
import { LocationUpgradeModule } from '@angular/common/upgrade';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // Other NgModule imports...
    LocationUpgradeModule.config(),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
