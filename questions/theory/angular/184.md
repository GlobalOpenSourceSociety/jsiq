### How can I translate attribute?

You can translate attributes by attaching `i18n-x` attribute where x is the name of the attribute to translate. For example, you can translate image title attribute as below,

```html
<img [src]="example" i18n-title title="Internationlization" />
```

By the way, you can also assign meaning, description and id with the i18n-x="<meaning>|<description>@@<id>" syntax.
