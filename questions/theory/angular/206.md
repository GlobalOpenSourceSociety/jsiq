### Is it possible to do aliasing for inputs and outputs?

Yes, it is possible to do aliasing for inputs and outputs in two ways.

1. **Aliasing in metadata:** The inputs and outputs in the metadata aliased using a colon-delimited (:) string with the directive property name on the left and the public alias on the right. i.e. It will be in the format of propertyName:alias.
   ```javascript
   inputs: ['input1: buyItem'],
   outputs: ['outputEvent1: completedEvent']
   ```
2. **Aliasing with @Input()/@Output() decorator:** The alias can be specified for the property name by passing the alias name to the @Input()/@Output() decorator.i.e. It will be in the form of @Input(alias) or @Output(alias).
   ```javascript
   @Input('buyItem') input1: string;
   @Output('completedEvent') outputEvent1 = new EventEmitter<string>();
   ```
