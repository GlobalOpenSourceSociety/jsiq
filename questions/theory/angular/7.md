# What are components?

Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app which formed a tree of Angular components. These components are subset of directives. Unlike directives, components always have a template and only one component can be instantiated per an element in a template. Let's see a simple example of Angular component

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <div>
      <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
      <div>Learn Angular6 with examples</div>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  title: string = 'Welcome to Angular world';
}
```
