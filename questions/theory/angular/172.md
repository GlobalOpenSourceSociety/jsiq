# Is angular prevents http level vulnerabilities?

Angular has built-in support for preventing http level vulnerabilities such as as cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) and cross-site script inclusion (XSSI). Even though these vulnerabilities need to be mitigated on server-side, Angular provides helpers to make the integration easier on the client side.

1. HttpClient supports a token mechanism used to prevent XSRF attacks
2. HttpClient library recognizes the convention of prefixed JSON responses(which non-executable js code with ")]}',\\n" characters) and automatically strips the string ")]}',\\n" from all responses before further parsing
