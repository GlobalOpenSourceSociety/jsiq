### What are feature modules?

Feature modules are NgModules, which are used for the purpose of organizing code. The feature module can be created with Angular CLI using the below command in the root directory,

```javascript
ng generate module MyCustomFeature //
```

Angular CLI creates a folder called `my-custom-feature` with a file inside called `my-custom-feature.module.ts` with the following contents

```javascript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

@NgModule({
  imports: [CommonModule],
  declarations: [],
})
export class MyCustomFeature {}
```

**Note:** The "Module" suffix shouldn't present in the name because the CLI appends it.
