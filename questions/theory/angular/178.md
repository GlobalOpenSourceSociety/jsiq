# How do you manually register locale data?

By default, Angular only contains locale data for en-US which is English as spoken in the United States of America . But if you want to set to another locale, you must import locale data for that new locale. After that you can register using `registerLocaleData` method and the syntax of this method looks like below,

```javascript
registerLocaleData(data: any, localeId?: any, extraData?: any): void
```

For example, let us import German locale and register it in the application

```javascript
import { registerLocaleData } from '@angular/common';
import localeDe from '@angular/common/locales/de';

registerLocaleData(localeDe, 'de');
```
