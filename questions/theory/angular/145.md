# How do you upgrade angular version?

The Angular upgrade is quite easier using Angular CLI `ng update` command as mentioned below. For example, if you upgrade from Angular 7 to 8 then your lazy loaded route imports will be migrated to the new import syntax automatically.

```bash
$ ng update @angular/cli @angular/core
```
