### What are the methods of NgZone used to control change detection?

NgZone service provides a `run()` method that allows you to execute a function inside the angular zone. This function is used to execute third party APIs which are not handled by Zone and trigger change detection automatically at the correct time.

```js
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {}
  ngOnInit() {
    // use ngZone.run() to make the asynchronous operation in the angular zone
    this.ngZone.run(() => {
      someNewAsyncAPI(() => {
        // update the data of the component
      });
    });
  }
}
```

Whereas `runOutsideAngular()` method is used when you don't want to trigger change detection.

```js
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {}
  ngOnInit() {
    // Use this method when you know no data will be updated
    this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        // update component data and don't trigger change detection
      });
    });
  }
}
```
