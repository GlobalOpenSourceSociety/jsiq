# How to transfer components to custom elements?

Transforming components to custom elements involves **two** major steps,

1. **Build custom element class:** Angular provides the `createCustomElement()` function for converting an Angular component (along with its dependencies) to a custom element. The conversion process implements `NgElementConstructor` interface, and creates a constructor class which is used to produce a self-bootstrapping instance of Angular component.
2. **Register element class with browser:** It uses `customElements.define()` JS function, to register the configured constructor and its associated custom-element tag with the browser's `CustomElementRegistry`. When the browser encounters the tag for the registered element, it uses the constructor to create a custom-element instance.

The detailed structure would be as follows, ![CreateElement](images/createElement.png)
