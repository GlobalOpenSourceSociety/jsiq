# What is the reason for No provider for HTTP exception?

This exception is due to missing HttpClientModule in your module. You just need to import in module as below,

```javascript
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

@NgModule({
  imports: [BrowserModule, HttpClientModule],
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
