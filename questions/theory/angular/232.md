### What is a provider?

A provider is an instruction to the Dependency Injection system on how to obtain a value for a dependency(aka services created). The service can be provided using Angular CLI as below,

```javascript
ng generate service my-service
```

The created service by CLI would be as below,

```js
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root', //Angular provide the service in root injector
})
export class MyService {}
```
