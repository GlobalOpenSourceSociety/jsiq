# What is AOT?

Ahead-of-Time (AOT) is a type of compilation that compiles your app at build time. For AOT compilation, include the `--aot` option with the ng build or ng serve command as below,

```cmd
ng build --aot
ng serve --aot
```

**Note:** The ng build command with the --prod meta-flag (`ng build --prod`) compiles with AOT by default.
