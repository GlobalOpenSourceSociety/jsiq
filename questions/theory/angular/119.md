# What are the limitations with web workers?

You need to remember two important things when using Web Workers in Angular projects,

1. Some environments or platforms(like @angular/platform-server) used in Server-side Rendering, don't support Web Workers. In this case you need to provide a fallback mechanism to perform the computations to work in this environments.
2. Running Angular in web worker using `@angular/platform-webworker` is not yet supported in Angular CLI.
