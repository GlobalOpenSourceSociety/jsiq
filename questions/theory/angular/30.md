### How do you chain pipes?

You can chain pipes together in potentially useful combinations as per the needs. Let's take a birthday property which uses date pipe(along with parameter) and uppercase pipes as below

```javascript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-birthday',
  template: `<p>Birthday is {{ birthday | date: 'fullDate' | uppercase }}</p>`, // THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 1987
})
export class BirthdayComponent {
  birthday = new Date(1987, 6, 18);
}
```
