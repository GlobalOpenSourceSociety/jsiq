### What is Angular Ivy?

Angular Ivy is a new rendering engine for Angular. You can choose to opt in a preview version of Ivy from Angular version 8.

1. You can enable ivy in a new project by using the --enable-ivy flag with the ng new command

   ```bash
   ng new ivy-demo-app --enable-ivy
   ```

2. You can add it to an existing project by adding `enableIvy` option in the `angularCompilerOptions` in your project's `tsconfig.app.json`.

   ```javascript
   {
     "compilerOptions": { ... },
     "angularCompilerOptions": {
       "enableIvy": true
     }
   }
   ```
