# What is the purpose of metadata json files?

The metadata.json file can be treated as a diagram of the overall structure of a decorator's metadata, represented as an abstract syntax tree(AST). During the analysis phase, the AOT collector scan the metadata recorded in the Angular decorators and outputs metadata information in .metadata.json files, one per .d.ts file.
