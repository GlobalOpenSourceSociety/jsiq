# What is HttpClient and its benefits?

Most of the Front-end applications communicate with backend services over HTTP protocol using either XMLHttpRequest interface or the fetch() API. Angular provides a simplified client HTTP API known as **HttpClient** which is based on top of XMLHttpRequest interface. This client is avaialble from `@angular/common/http` package. You can import in your root module as below,

```javascript
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
```

The major advantages of HttpClient can be listed as below,

1. Contains testability features
2. Provides typed request and response objects
3. Intercept request and response
4. Supports Observalbe APIs
5. Supports streamlined error handling
