# What is a service worker and its role in Angular?

A service worker is a script that runs in the web browser and manages caching for an application. Starting from 5.0.0 version, Angular ships with a service worker implementation. Angular service worker is designed to optimize the end user experience of using an application over a slow or unreliable network connection, while also minimizing the risks of serving outdated content.
