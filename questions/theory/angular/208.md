# Is any special configuration required for Angular9?

You don't need any special configuration. In Angular9, the Ivy renderer is the default Angular compiler. Even though Ivy is available Angular8 itself, you had to configure it in tsconfig.json file as below,

```javascript
"angularCompilerOptions": {    "enableIvy": true  }
```
