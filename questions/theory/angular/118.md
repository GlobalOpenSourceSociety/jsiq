# How do you add web workers in your application?

You can add web worker anywhere in your application. For example, If the file that contains your expensive computation is `src/app/app.component.ts`, you can add a Web Worker using `ng generate web-worker app` command which will create `src/app/app.worker.ts` web worker file. This command will perform below actions,

1. Configure your project to use Web Workers
2. Adds app.worker.ts to receive messages
   ```javascript
   addEventListener('message', ({ data }) => {
     const response = `worker response to ${data}`;
     postMessage(response);
   });
   ```
3. The component `app.component.ts` file updated with web worker file
   ```javascript
   if (typeof Worker !== 'undefined') {
     // Create a new
     const worker = new Worker('./app.worker', { type: 'module' });
     worker.onmessage = ({ data }) => {
       console.log('page got message: ${data}');
     };
     worker.postMessage('hello');
   } else {
     // Web Workers are not supported in this environment.
   }
   ```

**Note:** You may need to refactor your initial scaffolding web worker code for sending messages to and from.
