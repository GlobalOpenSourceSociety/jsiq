# What are the two phases of AOT?

The AOT compiler works in three phases,

1. **Code Analysis:** The compiler records a representation of the source
2. **Code generation:** It handles the interpretation as well as places restrictions on what it interprets.
3. **Validation:** In this phase, the Angular template compiler uses the TypeScript compiler to validate the binding expressions in templates.
