# What is the difference between promise and observable?

Below are the list of differences between promise and observable,

| Observable | Promise |
| --- | --- |
| Declarative: Computation does not start until subscription so that they can be run whenever you need the result | Execute immediately on creation |
| Provide multiple values over time | Provide only one |
| Subscribe method is used for error handling which makes centralized and predictable error handling | Push errors to the child promises |
| Provides chaining and subscription to handle complex applications | Uses only .then() clause |
