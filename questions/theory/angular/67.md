# What are router links?

The RouterLink is a directive on the anchor tags give the router control over those elements. Since the navigation paths are fixed, you can assign string values to router-link directive as below,

```html
<h1>Angular Router</h1>
<nav>
  <a routerLink="/todosList">List of todos</a>
  <a routerLink="/completed">Completed todos</a>
</nav>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```
