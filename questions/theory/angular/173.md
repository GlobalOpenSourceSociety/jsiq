### What are Http Interceptors?

Http Interceptors are part of @angular/common/http, which inspect and transform HTTP requests from your application to the server and vice-versa on HTTP responses. These interceptors can perform a variety of implicit tasks, from authentication to logging.

The syntax of HttpInterceptor interface looks like as below,

```javascript
interface HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>>;
}
```

You can use interceptors by declaring a service class that implements the intercept() method of the HttpInterceptor interface.

```javascript
@Injectable()
export class MyInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
    constructor() {}
    intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
        ...
    }
}
```

After that you can use it in your module,

```javascript
@NgModule({
    ...
    providers: [
        {
            provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
            useClass: MyInterceptor,
            multi: true
        }
    ]
    ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```
