### Is multiple interceptors supported in Angular?

Yes, Angular supports multiple interceptors at a time. You could define multiple interceptors in providers property:

```javascript
providers: [
  { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: MyFirstInterceptor, multi: true },
  { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: MySecondInterceptor, multi: true }
],
```

The interceptors will be called in the order in which they were provided. i.e, MyFirstInterceptor will be called first in the above interceptors configuration.
