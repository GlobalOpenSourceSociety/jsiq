# What is the purpose of hidden property?

The hidden property is used to show or hide the associated DOM element, based on an expression. It can be compared close to `ng-show` directive in AngularJS. Let's say you want to show user name based on the availability of user using `hidden` property.

```javascript
<div [hidden]="!user.name">
  My name is: {{user.name}}
</div>
```
