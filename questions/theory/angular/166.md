# What is the purpose of innerHTML?

The innerHtml is a property of HTML-Elements, which allows you to set it's html-content programmatically. Let's display the below html code snippet in a `<div>` tag as below using innerHTML binding,

```html
<div [innerHTML]="htmlSnippet"></div>
```

and define the htmlSnippet property from any component

```javascript
export class myComponent {
  htmlSnippet: string = '<b>Hello World</b>, Angular';
}
```

Unfortunately this property could cause Cross Site Scripting (XSS) security bugs when improperly handled.
