# How do you describe various dependencies in angular application?

The dependencies section of package.json with in an angular application can be divided as follow,

1. **Angular packages:** Angular core and optional modules; their package names begin @angular/.
2. **Support packages:** Third-party libraries that must be present for Angular apps to run.
3. **Polyfill packages:** Polyfills plug gaps in a browser's JavaScript implementation.
