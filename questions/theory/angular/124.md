# What are the case types in Angular?

Angular uses capitalization conventions to distinguish the names of various types. Angular follows the list of the below case types.

1. **camelCase :** Symbols, properties, methods, pipe names, non-component directive selectors, constants uses lowercase on the first letter of the item. For example, "selectedUser"
2. **UpperCamelCase (or PascalCase):** Class names, including classes that define components, interfaces, NgModules, directives, and pipes uses uppercase on the first letter of the item.
3. **dash-case (or "kebab-case"):** The descriptive part of file names, component selectors uses dashes between the words. For example, "app-user-list".
4. **UPPER_UNDERSCORE_CASE:** All constants uses capital letters connected with underscores. For example, "NUMBER_OF_USERS".
