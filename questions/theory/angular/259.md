# What are the differences between reactive forms and template driven forms?

Below are the main differences between reactive forms and template driven forms

| Feature | Reactive | Template-Driven |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Form model setup | Created(FormControl instance) in component explicitly | Created by directives |
| Data updates | Synchronous | Asynchronous |
| Form custom validation | Defined as Functions | Defined as Directives |
| Testing | No interaction with change detection cycle | Need knowledge of the change detection process |
| Mutability | Immutable(by always returning new value for FormControl instance) | Mutable(Property always modified to new value) |
| Scalability | More scalable using low-level APIs | Less scalable using due to abstraction on APIs |
