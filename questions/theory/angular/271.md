# How do you get the current route?

In Angular, there is an `url` property of router package to get the current route. You need to follow the below few steps,

1. Import Router from @angular/router

```js
import { Router } from '@angular/router';
```

2. Inject router inside constructor

```js
constructor(private router: Router ) {

}
```

3. Access url parameter

```js
console.log(this.router.url); //  /routename
```
