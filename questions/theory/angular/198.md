# What is router state?

The RouteState is an interface which represents the state of the router as a tree of activated routes.

```javascript
interface RouterState extends Tree {
  snapshot: RouterStateSnapshot
  toString(): string
}
```

You can access the current RouterState from anywhere in the Angular app using the Router service and the routerState property.
