### What is angular animation?

Angular's animation system is built on CSS functionality in order to animate any property that the browser considers animatable. These properties includes positions, sizes, transforms, colors, borders etc. The Angular modules for animations are **@angular/animations** and **@angular/platform-browser** and these dependencies are automatically added to your project when you create a project using Angular CLI.
