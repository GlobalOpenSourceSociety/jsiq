# How does forRoot method helpful to avoid duplicate router instances?

If the `RouterModule` module didnâ€™t have forRoot() static method then each feature module would instantiate a new Router instance, which leads to broken application due to duplicate instances. After using forRoot() method, the root application module imports `RouterModule.forRoot(...)` and gets a Router, and all feature modules import `RouterModule.forChild(...)` which does not instantiate another Router.
