# What is declarable in Angular?

Declarable is a class type that you can add to the declarations list of an NgModule. The class types such as components, directives, and pipes comes can be declared in the module. The structure of declarations would be,

```javascript
declarations: [
  YourComponent,
  YourPipe,
  YourDirective
],
```
