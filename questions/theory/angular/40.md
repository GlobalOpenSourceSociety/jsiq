### What is RxJS?

RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and callback-based code in a functional, reactive style using Observables. Many APIs such as HttpClient produce and consume RxJS Observables and also uses operators for processing observables.

For example, you can import observables and operators for using HttpClient as below,

```javascript
import { Observable, throwError } from 'rxjs';
import { catchError, retry } from 'rxjs/operators';
```
