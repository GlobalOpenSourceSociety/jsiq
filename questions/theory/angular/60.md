### What are the various kinds of directives?

There are mainly three kinds of directives,

1. **Components** — These are directives with a template.
2. **Structural directives** — These directives change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.
3. **Attribute directives** — These directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.
