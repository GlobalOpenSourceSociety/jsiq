### What is Angular Language Service?

The Angular Language Service is a way to get completions, errors, hints, and navigation inside your Angular templates whether they are external in an HTML file or embedded in annotations/decorators in a string. It has the ability to autodetect that you are opening an Angular file, reads your `tsconfig.json` file, finds all the templates you have in your application, and then provides all the language services.
