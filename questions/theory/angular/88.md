### What are macros?

The AOT compiler supports macros in the form of functions or static methods that return an expression in a `single return expression`. For example, let us take a below macro function,

```javascript
export function wrapInArray<T>(value: T): T[] {
  return [value];
}
```

You can use it inside metadata as an expression,

```javascript
@NgModule({
  declarations: wrapInArray(TypicalComponent),
})
export class TypicalModule {}
```

The compiler treats the macro expression as it written directly

```javascript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [TypicalComponent],
})
export class TypicalModule {}
```
