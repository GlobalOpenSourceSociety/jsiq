### Can I use any javascript feature for expression syntax in AOT?

No, the AOT collector understands a subset of (or limited) JavaScript features. If an expression uses unsupported syntax, the collector writes an error node to the .metadata.json file. Later point of time, the compiler reports an error if it needs that piece of metadata to generate the application code.
