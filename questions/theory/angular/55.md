# Explain how custom elements works internally?

Below are the steps in an order about custom elements functionality,

1. **App registers custom element with browser:** Use the `createCustomElement()` function to convert a component into a class that can be registered with the browser as a custom element.
2. **App adds custom element to DOM:** Add custom element just like a built-in HTML element directly into the DOM.
3. **Browser instantiate component based class:** Browser creates an instance of the registered class and adds it to the DOM.
4. **Instance provides content with data binding and change detection:** The content with in template is rendered using the component and DOM data. The flow chart of the custom elements functionality would be as follows,
