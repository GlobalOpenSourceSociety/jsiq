### What is select ICU expression?

ICU expression is is similar to the plural expressions except that you choose among alternative translations based on a string value instead of a number. Here you define those string values.

Let's take component binding with `residenceStatus` property which has "citizen", "permanent resident" and "foreigner" possible values and the message maps those values to the appropriate translations.

```javascript
<span i18n>The person is {residenceStatus, select, citizen {citizen} permanent resident {permanentResident} foreigner {foreigner}}</span>
```
