### How do you test Angular application using CLI?

Angular CLI downloads and install everything needed with the Jasmine Test framework. You just need to run `ng test` to see the test results. By default this command builds the app in watch mode, and launches the `Karma test runner`. The output of test results would be as below,

```bash
10% building modules 1/1 modules 0 active
...INFO [karma]: Karma v1.7.1 server started at http://0.0.0.0:9876/
...INFO [launcher]: Launching browser Chrome ...
...INFO [launcher]: Starting browser Chrome
...INFO [Chrome ...]: Connected on socket ...
Chrome ...: Executed 3 of 3 SUCCESS (0.135 secs / 0.205 secs)
```

**Note:** A chrome browser also opens and displays the test output in the "Jasmine HTML Reporter".
