### What is subscribing?

An Observable instance begins publishing values only when someone subscribes to it. So you need to subscribe by calling the **subscribe()** method of the instance, passing an observer object to receive the notifications.

Let's take an example of creating and subscribing to a simple observable, with an observer that logs the received message to the console.

```javascript
Creates an observable sequence of 5 integers, starting from 1
const source = range(1, 5);

// Create observer object
const myObserver = {
next: x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),
error: err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),
complete: () => console.log('Observer got a complete notification'),
};

// Execute with the observer object and Prints out each item
source.subscribe(myObserver);
// => Observer got a next value: 1
// => Observer got a next value: 2
// => Observer got a next value: 3
// => Observer got a next value: 4
// => Observer got a next value: 5
// => Observer got a complete notification
```
