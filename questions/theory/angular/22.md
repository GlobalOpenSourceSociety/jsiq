# What is the purpose of ngIf directive?

Sometimes an app needs to display a view or a portion of a view only under specific circumstances. The Angular ngIf directive inserts or removes an element based on a truthy/falsy condition. Let's take an example to display a message if the user age is more than 18,

```html
<p *ngIf="user.age > 18">You are not eligible for student pass!</p>
```

**Note:** Angular isn't showing and hiding the message. It is adding and removing the paragraph element from the DOM. That improves performance, especially in the larger projects with many data bindings.
