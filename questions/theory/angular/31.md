# What is a custom pipe?

Apart from built-inn pipes, you can write your own custom pipe with the below key characteristics,

1. A pipe is a class decorated with pipe metadata **@Pipe** decorator, which you import from the core Angular library For example,

```javascript
    @Pipe({name: 'myCustomPipe'})
```

2. The pipe class implements the **PipeTransform** interface's transform method that accepts an input value followed by optional parameters and returns the transformed value. The structure of pipeTransform would be as below,

```javascript
interface PipeTransform {
  transform(value: any, ...args: any[]): any;
}
```

3. The @Pipe decorator allows you to define the pipe name that you'll use within template expressions. It must be a valid JavaScript identifier.

```javascript
template: `{{someInputValue | myCustomPipe: someOtherValue}}`;
```
