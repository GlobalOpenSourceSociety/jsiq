### Is mandatory to pass static flag for ViewChild?

In Angular 8, the static flag is required for ViewChild. Whereas in Angular9, you no longer need to pass this property. Once you updated to Angular9 using `ng update`, the migration will remove { static: false } script everywhere.

```javascript
@ViewChild(ChildDirective) child: ChildDirective; // Angular9 usage
@ViewChild(ChildDirective, { static: false }) child: ChildDirective; //Angular8 usage
```
