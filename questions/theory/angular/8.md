### What are the differences between Component and Directive?

In a short note, A component(@component) is a directive-with-a-template.

Some of the major differences are mentioned in a tabular form

| Component | Directive |
| --- | --- |
| To register a component we use @Component meta-data annotation | To register directives we use @Directive meta-data annotation |
| Components are typically used to create UI widgets | Directive is used to add behavior to an existing DOM element |
| Component is used to break up the application into smaller components | Directive is use to design re-usable components |
| Only one component can be present per DOM element | Many directives can be used per DOM element |
| @View decorator or templateurl/template are mandatory | Directive doesn't use View |
