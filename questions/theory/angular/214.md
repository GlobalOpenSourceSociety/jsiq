### What is a bootstrapped component?

A bootstrapped component is an entry component that Angular loads into the DOM during the bootstrap process or application launch time. Generally, this bootstrapped or root component is named as `AppComponent` in your root module using `bootstrap` property as below.

```js
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpClientModule,
    AppRoutingModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent] // bootstrapped entry component need to be declared here
})
```
