### How do you use Bazel with Angular CLI?

The @angular/bazel package provides a builder that allows Angular CLI to use Bazel as the build tool.

1. **Use in an existing applciation:** Add @angular/bazel using CLI
   ```javascript
   ng add @angular/bazel
   ```
2. **Use in a new application:** Install the package and create the application with collection option `javascript npm install -g @angular/bazel ng new --collection=@angular/bazel ` When you use ng build and ng serve commands, Bazel is used behind the scenes and outputs the results in dist/bin folder.
