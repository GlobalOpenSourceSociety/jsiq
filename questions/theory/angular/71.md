### What is activated route?

ActivatedRoute contains the information about a route associated with a component loaded in an outlet. It can also be used to traverse the router state tree. The ActivatedRoute will be injected as a router service to access the information. In the below example, you can access route path and parameters,

```javascript
@Component({...})
class MyComponent {
constructor(route: ActivatedRoute) {
  const id: Observable<string> = route.params.pipe(map(p => p.id));
  const url: Observable<string> = route.url.pipe(map(segments => segments.join('')));
  // route.data includes both `data` and `resolve`
  const user = route.data.pipe(map(d => d.user));
}
}
```
