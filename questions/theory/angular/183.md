# Can I translate text without creating an element?

Yes, you can achieve using `<ng-container>` attribute. Normally you need to wrap a text content with i18n attribute for the translation. But if you don't want to create a new DOM element just for the sake of translation, you can wrap the text in an `<ng-container>` element.

```html
<ng-container i18n>I'm not using any DOM element for translation</ng-container>
```

Remember that `<ng-container>` is transformed into an html comment
