# Give an example for attribute directives?

Let's take simple highlighter behavior as a example directive for DOM element. You can create and apply the attribute directive using below steps,

1. Create HighlightDirective class with the file name `src/app/highlight.directive.ts`. In this file, we need to import **Directive** from core library to apply the metadata and **ElementRef** in the directive's constructor to inject a reference to the host DOM element ,

```javascript
import { Directive, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]',
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(el: ElementRef) {
    el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
  }
}
```

2. Apply the attribute directive as an attribute to the host element(for example, `<p>`)

```javascript
<p appHighlight>Highlight me!</p>
```

3. Run the application to see the highlight behavior on paragraph element

```javascript
ng serve
```
