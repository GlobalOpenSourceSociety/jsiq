# Can you name two programming paradigms important for JavaScript app developers?

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting **imperative/procedural** programming along with **OOP** (Object-Oriented Programming) and **functional programming**. JavaScript supports OOP with **prototypal inheritance**.

## Good to hear:

- Prototypal inheritance (also: prototypes, OLOO).
- Functional programming (also: closures, first class functions, lambdas).

## Red flags:
- No clue what a paradigm is, no mention of prototypal oo or functional programming.
