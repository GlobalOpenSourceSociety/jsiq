### What are the limitations of React?

Apart from the advantages, there are few limitations of React too,

1. React is just a view library, not a full framework.
2. There is a learning curve for beginners who are new to web development.
3. Integrating React into a traditional MVC framework requires some additional configuration.
4. The code complexity increases with inline templating and JSX.
5. Too many smaller components leading to over engineering or boilerplate.
