### How to use innerHTML in React?

The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute is React's replacement for using `innerHTML` in the browser DOM. Just like `innerHTML`, it is risky to use this attribute considering cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. You just need to pass a `__html` object as key and HTML text as value.

In this example MyComponent uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute for setting HTML markup:

```jsx
function createMarkup() {
  return { __html: 'First &middot; Second' };
}

function MyComponent() {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup()} />;
}
```
