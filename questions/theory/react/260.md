# What are the advantages of formik over redux form library?

Below are the main reasons to recommend formik over redux form library,

1. The form state is inherently short-term and local, so tracking it in Redux (or any kind of Flux library) is unnecessary.
2. Redux-Form calls your entire top-level Redux reducer multiple times ON EVERY SINGLE KEYSTROKE. This way it increases input latency for large apps.
3. Redux-Form is 22.5 kB minified gzipped whereas Formik is 12.7 kB
