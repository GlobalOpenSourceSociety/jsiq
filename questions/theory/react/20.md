### How to create refs?

There are two approaches

1. This is a recently added approach. _Refs_ are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use _refs_ throughout the component, just assign the _ref_ to the instance property within constructor.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.myRef = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={this.myRef} />;
  }
}
```

2. You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element accessed as follows,

```jsx
class SearchBar extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.txtSearch = null;
    this.state = { term: '' };
    this.setInputSearchRef = (e) => {
      this.txtSearch = e;
    };
  }
  onInputChange(event) {
    this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <input
        value={this.state.term}
        onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)}
        ref={this.setInputSearchRef}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

You can also use _refs_ in function components using **closures**. **Note**: You can also use inline ref callbacks even though it is not a recommended approach
