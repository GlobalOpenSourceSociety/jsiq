### What are React Mixins?

_Mixins_ are a way to totally separate components to have a common functionality. Mixins **should not be used** and can be replaced with _higher-order components_ or _decorators_.

One of the most commonly used mixins is `PureRenderMixin`. You might be using it in some components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props and state are shallowly equal to the previous props and state:

```javascript
const PureRenderMixin = require('react-addons-pure-render-mixin');

const Button = React.createClass({
  mixins: [PureRenderMixin],
  // ...
});
```
