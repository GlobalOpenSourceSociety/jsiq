# What is the difference between `setState()` and `replaceState()` methods?

When you use `setState()` the current and previous states are merged. `replaceState()` throws out the current state, and replaces it with only what you provide. Usually `setState()` is used unless you really need to remove all previous keys for some reason. You can also set state to `false`/`null` in `setState()` instead of using `replaceState()`.
