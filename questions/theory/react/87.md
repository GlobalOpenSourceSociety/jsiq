# Why should component names start with capital letter?

If you are rendering your component using JSX, the name of that component has to begin with a capital letter otherwise React will throw an error as unrecognized tag. This convention is because only HTML elements and SVG tags can begin with a lowercase letter.

```jsx
class SomeComponent extends Component {
  // Code goes here
}
```

You can define component class which name starts with lowercase letter, but when it's imported it should have capital letter. Here lowercase is fine:

```jsx
class myComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div />;
  }
}

export default myComponent;
```

While when imported in another file it should start with capital letter:

```jsx
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
```

## What are the exceptions on React component naming?

The component names should start with a uppercase letter but there are few exceptions on this convention. The lowercase tag names with a dot (property accessors) are still considered as valid component names.

For example the below tag can be compiled to a valid component,

```javascript
render(){
  return (
      <obj.component /> // `React.createElement(obj.component)`
      )
}
```
