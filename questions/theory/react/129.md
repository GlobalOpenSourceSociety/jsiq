### What is the purpose of `push()` and `replace()` methods of `history`?

A history instance has two methods for navigation purpose.

1. `push()`
2. `replace()`

If you think of the history as an array of visited locations, `push()` will add a new location to the array and `replace()` will replace the current location in the array with the new one.
