# How to pretty print JSON with React?

We can use `<pre>` tag so that the formatting of the `JSON.stringify()` is retained:

```jsx
const data = { name: 'John', age: 42 };

class User extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>;
  }
}

React.render(<User />, document.getElementById('container'));
```
