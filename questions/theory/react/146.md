# Give a simple example of Jest test case

Let's write a test for a function that adds two numbers in `sum.js` file:

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

export default sum;
```

Create a file named `sum.test.js` which contains actual test:

```javascript
import sum from './sum';

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

And then add the following section to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

Finally, run `yarn test` or `npm test` and Jest will print a result:

```console
$ yarn test
PASS ./sum.test.js
âœ“ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (2ms)
```

# What is flux?

_Flux_ is an _application design paradigm_ used as a replacement for the more traditional MVC pattern. It is not a framework or a library but a new kind of architecture that complements React and the concept of Unidirectional Data Flow. Facebook uses this pattern internally when working with React.

The workflow between dispatcher, stores and views components with distinct inputs and outputs as follows:
