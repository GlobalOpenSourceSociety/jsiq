### What is the difference between React and Angular?

Let's see the difference between React and Angular in a table format.

| React | Angular |
| --- | --- |
| React is a library and has only the View layer | Angular is a framework and has complete MVC functionality |
| React handles rendering on the server side | AngularJS renders only on the client side but Angular 2 and above renders on the server side |
| React uses JSX that looks like HTML in JS which can be confusing | Angular follows the template approach for HTML, which makes code shorter and easy to understand |
| React Native, which is a React type to build mobile applications are faster and more stable | Ionic, Angular's mobile native app is relatively less stable and slower |
| In React, data flows only in one way and hence debugging is easy | In Angular, data flows both way i.e it has two-way data binding between children and parent and hence debugging is often difficult |

**Note:** The above list of differences are purely opinionated and it vary based on the professional experience. But they are helpful as base parameters.
