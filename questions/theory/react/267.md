# Give an example on How to use context?

**Context** is designed to share data that can be considered **global** for a tree of React components.

For example, in the code below lets manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component.

```javascript
//Lets create a context with a default theme value "luna"
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('luna');
// Create App component where it uses provider to pass theme value in the tree
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value="nova">
        <Toolbar />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}
// A middle component where you don't need to pass theme prop anymore
function Toolbar(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}
// Lets read theme value in the button component to use
class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
  static contextType = ThemeContext;
  render() {
    return <Button theme={this.context} />;
  }
}
```
