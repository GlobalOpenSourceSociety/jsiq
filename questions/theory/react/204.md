### Can I import an SVG file as react component?

You can import SVG directly as component instead of loading it as a file. This feature is available with `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher.

```jsx
import { ReactComponent as Logo } from './logo.svg';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    {/* Logo is an actual react component */}
    <Logo />
  </div>
);
```

**Note**: Don't forget about the curly braces in the import.
