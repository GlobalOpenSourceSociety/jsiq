# How to use styles in React?

The `style` attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string. This is consistent with the DOM style JavaScript property, is more efficient, and prevents XSS security holes.

```jsx
const divStyle = {
  color: 'blue',
  backgroundImage: 'url(' + imgUrl + ')',
};

function HelloWorldComponent() {
  return <div style={divStyle}>Hello World!</div>;
}
```

Style keys are camelCased in order to be consistent with accessing the properties on DOM nodes in JavaScript (e.g. `node.style.backgroundImage`).
