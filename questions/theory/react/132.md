# Why you get "Router may have only one child element" warning?

You have to wrap your Route's in a `<Switch>` block because `<Switch>` is unique in that it renders a route exclusively.

At first you need to add `Switch` to your imports:

```javascript
import { Switch, Router, Route } from 'react-router';
```

Then define the routes within `<Switch>` block:

```jsx
<Router>
  <Switch>
    <Route {/* ... */} />
    <Route {/* ... */} />
  </Switch>
</Router>
```
