# What is the purpose of renderToNodeStream method?

The `ReactDOMServer#renderToNodeStream` method is used to generate HTML on the server and send the markup down on the initial request for faster page loads. It also helps search engines to crawl your pages easily for SEO purposes. **Note:** Remember this method is not available in the browser but only server.
