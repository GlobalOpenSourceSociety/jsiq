### What are the `<Router>` components of React Router v4?

React Router v4 provides below 3 `<Router>` components:

1. `<BrowserRouter>`
2. `<HashRouter>`
3. `<MemoryRouter>`

The above components will create _browser_, _hash_, and _memory_ history instances. React Router v4 makes the properties and methods of the `history` instance associated with your router available through the context in the `router` object.
