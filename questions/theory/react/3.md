# What is JSX?

_JSX_ is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript (the acronym stands for _JavaScript XML_). Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement()` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.

In the example below text inside `<h1>` tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{'Welcome to React world!'}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
