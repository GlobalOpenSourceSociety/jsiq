### What is the difference between Element and Component?

An _Element_ is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. _Elements_ can contain other _Elements_ in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated.

The object representation of React Element would be as follows:

```javascript
const element = React.createElement('div', { id: 'login-btn' }, 'Login');
```

The above `React.createElement()` function returns an object:

```javascript
{
  type: 'div',
  props: {
    children: 'Login',
    id: 'login-btn'
  }
}
```

And finally it renders to the DOM using `ReactDOM.render()`:

```html
<div id="login-btn">Login</div>
```

Whereas a **component** can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a `render()` method. Alternatively, in simple cases, it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:

```javascript
const Button = ({ onLogin }) => (
  <div id={'login-btn'} onClick={onLogin}>
    Login
  </div>
);
```

Then JSX gets transpiled to a `React.createElement()` function tree:

```javascript
const Button = ({ onLogin }) =>
  React.createElement('div', { id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin }, 'Login');
```
