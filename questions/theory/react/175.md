# What are the features of Redux DevTools?

Some of the main features of Redux DevTools are below,

1. Lets you inspect every state and action payload.
2. Lets you go back in time by _cancelling_ actions.
3. If you change the reducer code, each _staged_ action will be re-evaluated.
4. If the reducers throw, you will see during which action this happened, and what the error was.
5. With `persistState()` store enhancer, you can persist debug sessions across page reloads.
