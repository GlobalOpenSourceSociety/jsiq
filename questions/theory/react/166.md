### What are the different ways to write `mapDispatchToProps()`?

There are a few ways of binding _action creators_ to `dispatch()` in `mapDispatchToProps()`.

Below are the possible options:

```javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  action: () => dispatch(action()),
});
```

```javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  action: bindActionCreators(action, dispatch),
});
```

```javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = { action };
```

The third option is just a shorthand for the first one.
