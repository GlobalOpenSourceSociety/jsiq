# What is the recommended way for naming components?

It is recommended to name the component by reference instead of using `displayName`.

Using `displayName` for naming component:

```javascript
export default React.createClass({
  displayName: 'TodoApp',
  // ...
});
```

The **recommended** approach:

```javascript
export default class TodoApp extends React.Component {
  // ...
}
```
