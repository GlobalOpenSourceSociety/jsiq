# How do you programmatically navigate using React Router v4?

There are three different ways to achieve programmatic routing/navigation within components.

1. **Using the `withRouter()` higher-order function:**

   The `withRouter()` higher-order function will inject the history object as a prop of the component. This object provides `push()` and `replace()` methods to avoid the usage of context.

   ```jsx
   import { withRouter } from 'react-router-dom'; // this also works with 'react-router-native'

   const Button = withRouter(({ history }) => (
     <button
       type="button"
       onClick={() => {
         history.push('/new-location');
       }}
     >
       {'Click Me!'}
     </button>
   ));
   ```

2. **Using `<Route>` component and render props pattern:**

   The `<Route>` component passes the same props as `withRouter()`, so you will be able to access the history methods through the history prop.

   ```jsx
   import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';

   const Button = () => (
     <Route
       render={({ history }) => (
         <button
           type="button"
           onClick={() => {
             history.push('/new-location');
           }}
         >
           {'Click Me!'}
         </button>
       )}
     />
   );
   ```

3. **Using context:**

   This option is not recommended and treated as unstable API.

   ```jsx
   const Button = (props, context) => (
     <button
       type="button"
       onClick={() => {
         context.history.push('/new-location');
       }}
     >
       {'Click Me!'}
     </button>
   );

   Button.contextTypes = {
     history: React.PropTypes.shape({
       push: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired,
     }),
   };
   ```
