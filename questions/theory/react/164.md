### What is the difference between component and container in React Redux?

**Component** is a class or function component that describes the presentational part of your application.

**Container** is an informal term for a component that is connected to a Redux store. Containers _subscribe_ to Redux state updates and _dispatch_ actions, and they usually don't render DOM elements; they delegate rendering to presentational child components.
