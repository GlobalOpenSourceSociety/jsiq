### Why React tab is not showing up in DevTools?

When the page loads, _React DevTools_ sets a global named `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__`, then React communicates with that hook during initialization. If the website is not using React or if React fails to communicate with DevTools then it won't show up the tab.
