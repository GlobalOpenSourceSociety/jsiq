### How to import and export components using React and ES6?

You should use default for exporting the components

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import User from 'user';

export default class MyProfile extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <User type="customer">//...</User>;
  }
}
```

With the export specifier, the MyProfile is going to be the member and exported to this module and the same can be imported without mentioning the name in other components.
