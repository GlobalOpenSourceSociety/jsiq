# What are the sources used for introducing hooks?

Hooks got the ideas from several different sources. Below are some of them,

1. Previous experiments with functional APIs in the react-future repository
2. Community experiments with render prop APIs such as Reactions Component
3. State variables and state cells in DisplayScript.
4. Subscriptions in Rx.
5. Reducer components in ReasonReact.
