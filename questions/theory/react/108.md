### What are the possible ways of updating objects in state?

1. **Calling `setState()` with an object to merge with state:**

   - Using `Object.assign()` to create a copy of the object:

     ```javascript
     const user = Object.assign({}, this.state.user, { age: 42 });
     this.setState({ user });
     ```

   - Using _spread operator_:

     ```javascript
     const user = { ...this.state.user, age: 42 };
     this.setState({ user });
     ```

2. **Calling `setState()` with a function:**

   ```javascript
   this.setState((prevState) => ({
     user: {
       ...prevState.user,
       age: 42,
     },
   }));
   ```
