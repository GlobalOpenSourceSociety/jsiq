# What is suspense component?

If the module containing the dynamic import is not yet loaded by the time parent component renders, you must show some fallback content while youâ€™re waiting for it to load using a loading indicator. This can be done using **Suspense** component.

For example, the below code uses suspense component,

```javascript
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <OtherComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

As mentioned in the above code, Suspense is wrapped above the lazy component.
