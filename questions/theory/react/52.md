### What are the advantages of React?

Below are the list of main advantages of React,

1. Increases the application's performance with _Virtual DOM_.
2. JSX makes code easy to read and write.
3. It renders both on client and server side (_SSR_).
4. Easy to integrate with frameworks (Angular, Backbone) since it is only a view library.
5. Easy to write unit and integration tests with tools such as Jest.
