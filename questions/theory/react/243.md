### Does React support all HTML attributes?

As of React 16, both standard or custom DOM attributes are fully supported. Since React components often take both custom and DOM-related props, React uses the camelCase convention just like the DOM APIs.

Let us take few props with respect to standard HTML attributes,

```javascript
<div tabIndex="-1" />      // Just like node.tabIndex DOM API
<div className="Button" /> // Just like node.className DOM API
<input readOnly={true} />  // Just like node.readOnly DOM API
```

These props work similarly to the corresponding HTML attributes, with the exception of the special cases. It also support all SVG attributes.
