# How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?

You can use an _arrow function_ to wrap around an _event handler_ and pass parameters:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} />
```

This is an equivalent to calling `.bind`:

```jsx
<button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} />
```

Apart from these two approaches, you can also pass arguments to a function which is defined as arrow function

```jsx
<button onClick={this.handleClick(id)} />;
handleClick = (id) => () => {
  console.log('Hello, your ticket number is', id);
};
```
