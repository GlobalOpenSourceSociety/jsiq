# Why we need to be careful when spreading props on DOM elements?

When we _spread props_ we run into the risk of adding unknown HTML attributes, which is a bad practice. Instead we can use prop destructuring with `...rest` operator, so it will add only required props.

For example,

```jsx
const ComponentA = () => <ComponentB isDisplay={true} className={'componentStyle'} />;

const ComponentB = ({ isDisplay, ...domProps }) => <div {...domProps}>{'ComponentB'}</div>;
```
