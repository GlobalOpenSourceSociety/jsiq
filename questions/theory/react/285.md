### What is the typical use case of portals?

React portals are very useful when a parent component has overflow: hidden or has properties that affect the stacking context(z-index,position,opacity etc styles) and you need to visually “break out” of its container.

For example, dialogs, global message notifications, hovercards, and tooltips.
