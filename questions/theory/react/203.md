### How React PropTypes allow different types for one prop?

You can use `oneOfType()` method of `PropTypes`.

For example, the height property can be defined with either `string` or `number` type as below:

```javascript
Component.PropTypes = {
  size: PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.string, PropTypes.number]),
};
```
