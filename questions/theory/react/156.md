### How to use `connect()` from React Redux?

You need to follow two steps to use your store in your container:

1. **Use `mapStateToProps()`:** It maps the state variables from your store to the props that you specify.
2. **Connect the above props to your container:** The object returned by the `mapStateToProps` function is connected to the container. You can import `connect()` from `react-redux`.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { connect } from 'react-redux';

   class App extends React.Component {
     render() {
       return <div>{this.props.containerData}</div>;
     }
   }

   function mapStateToProps(state) {
     return { containerData: state.data };
   }

   export default connect(mapStateToProps)(App);
   ```
