# How to ensure hooks followed the rules in your project?

React team released an ESLint plugin called **eslint-plugin-react-hooks** that enforces these two rules. You can add this plugin to your project using the below command,

```javascript
npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks@next
```

And apply the below config in your ESLint config file,

```javascript
// Your ESLint configuration
{
  "plugins": [
    // ...
    "react-hooks"
  ],
  "rules": {
    // ...
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error"
  }
}
```

**Note:** This plugin is intended to use in Create React App by default.
