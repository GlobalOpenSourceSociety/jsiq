# How Relay is different from Redux?

Relay is similar to Redux in that they both use a single store. The main difference is that relay only manages state originated from the server, and all access to the state is used via _GraphQL_ queries (for reading data) and mutations (for changing data). Relay caches the data for you and optimizes data fetching for you, by fetching only changed data and nothing more.

# What is an action in Redux?

_Actions_ are plain JavaScript objects or payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed.

For example, let's take an action which represents adding a new todo item:

```
{
  type: ADD_TODO,
  text: 'Add todo item'
}
```
