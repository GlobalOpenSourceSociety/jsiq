# What is the browser support for react applications?

React supports all popular browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and above, although some polyfills are required for older browsers such as IE 9 and IE 10. If you use **es5-shim and es5-sham** polyfill then it even support old browsers that doesn't support ES5 methods.
