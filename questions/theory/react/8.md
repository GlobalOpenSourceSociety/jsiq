### What is state in React?

_State_ of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.

Let's create an user component with message state,

```jsx
class User extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      message: 'Welcome to React world',
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component. i.e, It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it.
