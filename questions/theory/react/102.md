# How to listen to state changes?

The `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method will be called when state changes. You can compare provided state and props values with current state and props to determine if something meaningful changed.

```
componentDidUpdate(object prevProps, object prevState)
```

**Note:** The previous releases of ReactJS also uses `componentWillUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)` for state changes. It has been deprecated in latest releases.
