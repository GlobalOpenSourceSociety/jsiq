### What is the difference between constructor and getInitialState?

You should initialize state in the constructor when using ES6 classes, and `getInitialState()` method when using `React.createClass()`.

**Using ES6 classes:**

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      /* initial state */
    };
  }
}
```

**Using `React.createClass()`:**

```javascript
const MyComponent = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return {
      /* initial state */
    };
  },
});
```

**Note:** `React.createClass()` is deprecated and removed in React v16. Use plain JavaScript classes instead.
