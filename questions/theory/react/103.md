# What is the recommended approach of removing an array element in React state?

The better approach is to use `Array.prototype.filter()` method.

For example, let's create a `removeItem()` method for updating the state.

```javascript
removeItem(index) {
  this.setState({
    data: this.state.data.filter((item, i) => i !== index)
  })
}
```
