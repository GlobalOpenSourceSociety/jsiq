### What is React memo function?

Class components can be restricted from rendering when their input props are the same using **PureComponent or shouldComponentUpdate**. Now you can do the same with function components by wrapping them in **React.memo**.

```jsx
const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  /* only rerenders if props change */
});
```
