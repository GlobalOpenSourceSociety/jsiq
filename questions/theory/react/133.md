### How to pass params to `history.push` method in React Router v4?

While navigating you can pass props to the `history` object:

```javascript
this.props.history.push({
  pathname: '/template',
  search: '?name=sudheer',
  state: { detail: response.data },
});
```

The `search` property is used to pass query params in `push()` method.
