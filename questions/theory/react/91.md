# What is the difference between `super()` and `super(props)` in React using ES6 classes?

When you want to access `this.props` in `constructor()` then you should pass props to `super()` method.

**Using `super(props)`:**

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log(this.props); // { name: 'John', ... }
  }
}
```

**Using `super()`:**

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super();
    console.log(this.props); // undefined
  }
}
```

Outside `constructor()` both will display same value for `this.props`.
