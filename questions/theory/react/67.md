# How do you conditionally render components?

In some cases you want to render different components depending on some state. JSX does not render `false` or `undefined`, so you can use conditional _short-circuiting_ to render a given part of your component only if a certain condition is true.

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (
  <div>
    <h2>{name}</h2>
    {address && <p>{address}</p>}
  </div>
);
```

If you need an `if-else` condition then use _ternary operator_.

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (
  <div>
    <h2>{name}</h2>
    {address ? <p>{address}</p> : <p>{'Address is not available'}</p>}
  </div>
);
```
