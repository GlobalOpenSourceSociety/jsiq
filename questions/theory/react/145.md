# What are the advantages of Jest over Jasmine?

There are couple of advantages compared to Jasmine:

- Automatically finds tests to execute in your source code.
- Automatically mocks dependencies when running your tests.
- Allows you to test asynchronous code synchronously.
- Runs your tests with a fake DOM implementation (via `jsdom`) so that your tests can be run on the command line.
- Runs tests in parallel processes so that they finish sooner.
