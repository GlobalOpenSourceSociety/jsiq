### What are the popular React-specific linters?

ESLint is a popular JavaScript linter. There are plugins available that analyse specific code styles. One of the most common for React is an npm package called `eslint-plugin-react`. By default, it will check a number of best practices, with rules checking things from keys in iterators to a complete set of prop types.

Another popular plugin is `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, which will help fix common issues with accessibility. As JSX offers slightly different syntax to regular HTML, issues with `alt` text and `tabindex`, for example, will not be picked up by regular plugins.
