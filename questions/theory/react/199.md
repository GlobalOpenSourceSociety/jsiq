# Does the statics object work with ES6 classes in React?

No, `statics` only works with `React.createClass()`:

```javascript
someComponent = React.createClass({
  statics: {
    someMethod: function () {
      // ..
    },
  },
});
```

But you can write statics inside ES6+ classes as below,

```javascript
class Component extends React.Component {
  static propTypes = {
    // ...
  };

  static someMethod() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

or writing them outside class as below,

```javascript
class Component extends React.Component {
  ....
}

Component.propTypes = {...}
Component.someMethod = function(){....}
```
