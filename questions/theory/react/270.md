# What is a consumer?

A Consumer is a React component that subscribes to context changes. It requires a function as a child which receives current context value as argument and returns a react node. The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above in the tree.

Lets take a simple example,

```javascript
<MyContext.Consumer>
  {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
</MyContext.Consumer>
```
