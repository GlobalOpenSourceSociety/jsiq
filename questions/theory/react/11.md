# Why should we not update the state directly?

If you try to update state directly then it won't re-render the component.

```javascript
//Wrong
this.state.message = 'Hello world';
```

Instead use `setState()` method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

```javascript
//Correct
this.setState({ message: 'Hello World' });
```

**Note:** You can directly assign to the state object either in _constructor_ or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax.
