# What are the major features of React?

The major features of React are:

- It uses **VirtualDOM** instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
- Supports **server-side rendering**.
- Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding.
- Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.
