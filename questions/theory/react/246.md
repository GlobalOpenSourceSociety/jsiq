### When component props defaults to true?

If you pass no value for a prop, it defaults to true. This behavior is available so that it matches the behavior of HTML.

For example, below expressions are equivalent,

```javascript
<MyInput autocomplete />

<MyInput autocomplete={true} />
```

**Note:** It is not recommended to use this approach because it can be confused with the ES6 object shorthand (example, `{name}` which is short for `{name: name}`)
