### How to programmatically trigger click event in React?

You could use the ref prop to acquire a reference to the underlying `HTMLInputElement` object through a callback, store the reference as a class property, then use that reference to later trigger a click from your event handlers using the `HTMLElement.click` method.

This can be done in two steps:

1. Create ref in render method:

   ```jsx
   <input ref={(input) => (this.inputElement = input)} />
   ```

2. Apply click event in your event handler:

   ```javascript
   this.inputElement.click();
   ```
