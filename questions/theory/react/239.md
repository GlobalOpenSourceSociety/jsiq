# What is the purpose of unmountComponentAtNode method?

This method is available from react-dom package and it removes a mounted React component from the DOM and clean up its event handlers and state. If no component was mounted in the container, calling this function does nothing. Returns true if a component was unmounted and false if there was no component to unmount.

The method signature would be as follows,

```javascript
ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container);
```
