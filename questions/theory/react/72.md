### How to enable production mode in React?

You should use Webpack's `DefinePlugin` method to set `NODE_ENV` to `production`, by which it strip out things like propType validation and extra warnings. Apart from this, if you minify the code, for example, Uglify's dead-code elimination to strip out development only code and comments, it will drastically reduce the size of your bundle.
