# What is children prop?

_Children_ is a prop (`this.props.children`) that allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use. Component tree put between component's opening and closing tag will be passed to that component as `children` prop.

There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop. These include `React.Children.map`, `React.Children.forEach`, `React.Children.count`, `React.Children.only`, `React.Children.toArray`.

A simple usage of children prop looks as below,

```jsx
const MyDiv = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return <div>{this.props.children}</div>;
  },
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyDiv>
    <span>{'Hello'}</span>
    <span>{'World'}</span>
  </MyDiv>,
  node,
);
```
