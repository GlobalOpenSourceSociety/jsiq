# How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?

There are 3 possible ways to achieve this:

1. **Binding in Constructor:** In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same thing applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.

```javascript
class Component extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

2. **Public class fields syntax:** If you don't like to use bind approach then _public class fields syntax_ can be used to correctly bind callbacks.

```jsx
handleClick = () => {
  console.log('this is:', this);
};
```

```jsx
<button onClick={this.handleClick}>{'Click me'}</button>
```

3. **Arrow functions in callbacks:** You can use _arrow functions_ directly in the callbacks.

```jsx
<button onClick={(event) => this.handleClick(event)}>{'Click me'}</button>
```

**Note:** If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. In those cases, it is preferred to go with `.bind()` or _public class fields syntax_ approach considering performance.
