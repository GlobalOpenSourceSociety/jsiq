### Can you describe about componentDidCatch lifecycle method signature?

The **componentDidCatch** lifecycle method is invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component. The method receives two parameters,

1. error: - The error object which was thrown
2. info: - An object with a componentStack key contains the information about which component threw the error.

The method structure would be as follows

```javascript
componentDidCatch(error, info);
```
