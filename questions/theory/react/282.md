# How do you create HOC using render props?

You can implement most higher-order components (HOC) using a regular component with a render prop. For example, if you would prefer to have a withMouse HOC instead of a `<Mouse>` component, you could easily create one using a regular `<Mouse>` with a render prop.

```javascript
function withMouse(Component) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <Mouse render={(mouse) => <Component {...this.props} mouse={mouse} />} />;
    }
  };
}
```

This way render props gives the flexibility of using either pattern.
