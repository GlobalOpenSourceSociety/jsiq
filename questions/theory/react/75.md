# What are the lifecycle methods going to be deprecated in React v16?

The following lifecycle methods going to be unsafe coding practices and will be more problematic with async rendering.

1. `componentWillMount()`
2. `componentWillReceiveProps()`
3. `componentWillUpdate()`

Starting with React v16.3 these methods are aliased with `UNSAFE_` prefix, and the unprefixed version will be removed in React v17.
