### What is the use of the `ownProps` parameter in `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()`?

If the `ownProps` parameter is specified, React Redux will pass the props that were passed to the component into your _connect_ functions. So, if you use a connected component:

```jsx
import ConnectedComponent from './containers/ConnectedComponent';

<ConnectedComponent user={'john'} />;
```

The `ownProps` inside your `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()` functions will be an object:

```javascript
{
  user: 'john';
}
```

You can use this object to decide what to return from those functions.
