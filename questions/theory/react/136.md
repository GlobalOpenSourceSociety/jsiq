### How to perform automatic redirect after login?

The `react-router` package provides `<Redirect>` component in React Router. Rendering a `<Redirect>` will navigate to a new location. Like server-side redirects, the new location will override the current location in the history stack.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Redirect } from 'react-router';

export default class LoginComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    if (this.state.isLoggedIn === true) {
      return <Redirect to="/your/redirect/page" />;
    } else {
      return <div>{'Login Please'}</div>;
    }
  }
}
```

### What is React Intl?

The _React Intl_ library makes internalization in React straightforward, with off-the-shelf components and an API that can handle everything from formatting strings, dates, and numbers, to pluralization. React Intl is part of _FormatJS_ which provides bindings to React via its components and API.
