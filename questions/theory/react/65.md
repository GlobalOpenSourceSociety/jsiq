# Is it good to use `setState()` in `componentWillMount()` method?

Yes, it is safe to use `setState()` inside `componentWillMount()` method. But at the same it is recommended to avoid async initialization in `componentWillMount()` lifecycle method. `componentWillMount()` is invoked immediately before mounting occurs. It is called before `render()`, therefore setting state in this method will not trigger a re-render. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in this method. We need to make sure async calls for component initialization happened in `componentDidMount()` instead of `componentWillMount()`.

```jsx
componentDidMount() {
axios.get(`api/todos`)
  .then((result) => {
    this.setState({
      messages: [...result.data]
    })
  })
}
```
