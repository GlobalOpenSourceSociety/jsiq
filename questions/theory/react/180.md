# How to set initial state in Redux?

You need to pass initial state as second argument to createStore:

```javascript
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  todos: todos,
  visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter,
});

const initialState = {
  todos: [{ id: 123, name: 'example', completed: false }],
};

const store = createStore(rootReducer, initialState);
```
