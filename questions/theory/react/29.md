### What are controlled components?

A component that controls the input elements within the forms on subsequent user input is called **Controlled Component**, i.e, every state mutation will have an associated handler function.

For example, to write all the names in uppercase letters, we use handleChange as below,

```javascript
handleChange(event) {
this.setState({value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()})
}
```
