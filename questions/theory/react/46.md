### What are fragments?

It's common pattern in React which is used for a component to return multiple elements. _Fragments_ let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

```jsx
render() {
return (
  <React.Fragment>
    <ChildA />
    <ChildB />
    <ChildC />
  </React.Fragment>
)
}
```

There is also a _shorter syntax_, but it's not supported in many tools:

```jsx
render() {
return (
  <>
    <ChildA />
    <ChildB />
    <ChildC />
  </>
)
}
```
