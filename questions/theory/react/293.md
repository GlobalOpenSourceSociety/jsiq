### How to fetch data with React Hooks?

The effect hook called `useEffect` is used to fetch the data with axios from the API and to set the data in the local state of the component with the state hookâ€™s update function.

Let's take an example in which it fetches list of react articles from the API

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState({ hits: [] });

  useEffect(async () => {
    const result = await axios('http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=react');

    setData(result.data);
  }, []);

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.hits.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.objectID}>
          <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Remember we provided an empty array as second argument to the effect hook to avoid activating it on component updates but only for the mounting of the component. i.e, It fetches only for component mount.
