### How to implement _default_ or _NotFound_ page?

A `<Switch>` renders the first child `<Route>` that matches. A `<Route>` with no path always matches. So you just need to simply drop path attribute as below

```jsx
<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
  <Route path="/user" component={User} />
  <Route component={NotFound} />
</Switch>
```
