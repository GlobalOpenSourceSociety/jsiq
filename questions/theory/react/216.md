### What are hooks?

Hooks is a new feature(React 16.8) that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class.

Let's see an example of useState hook example,

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
