# How to add multiple middlewares to Redux?

You can use `applyMiddleware()`.

For example, you can add `redux-thunk` and `logger` passing them as arguments to `applyMiddleware()`:

```javascript
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk, logger)(createStore);
```
