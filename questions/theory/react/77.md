# What is the purpose of `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` lifecycle method?

The new `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` lifecycle method is called right before DOM updates. The return value from this method will be passed as the third parameter to `componentDidUpdate()`.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

This lifecycle method along with `componentDidUpdate()` covers all the use cases of `componentWillUpdate()`.
