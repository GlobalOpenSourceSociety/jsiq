# What are loadable components?

If you want to do code-splitting in a server rendered app, it is recommend to use Loadable Components because React.lazy and Suspense is not yet available for server-side rendering. Loadable lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component.

Lets take an example,

```javascript
import loadable from '@loadable/component';

const OtherComponent = loadable(() => import('./OtherComponent'));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <OtherComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now OtherComponent will be loaded in a separated bundle
