### Can you force a component to re-render without calling setState?

By default, when your component's state or props change, your component will re-render. If your `render()` method depends on some other data, you can tell React that the component needs re-rendering by calling `forceUpdate()`.

```javascript
component.forceUpdate(callback);
```

It is recommended to avoid all uses of `forceUpdate()` and only read from `this.props` and `this.state` in `render()`.
