# What is the benefit of strict mode?

The `<StrictMode>` will be helpful in the below cases

1. Identifying components with **unsafe lifecycle methods**.
2. Warning about **legacy string ref** API usage.
3. Detecting unexpected **side effects**.
4. Detecting **legacy context** API.
5. Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage
