# How to loop inside JSX?

You can simply use `Array.prototype.map` with ES6 _arrow function_ syntax.

For example, the `items` array of objects is mapped into an array of components:

```jsx
<tbody>
  {items.map((item) => (
    <SomeComponent key={item.id} name={item.name} />
  ))}
</tbody>
```

But you can't iterate using `for` loop:

```jsx
<tbody>
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
  <SomeComponent key={items[i].id} name={items[i].name} />
}
</tbody>
```

This is because JSX tags are transpiled into _function calls_, and you can't use statements inside expressions. This may change thanks to `do` expressions which are _stage 1 proposal_.
