# How do you access props in attribute quotes?

React (or JSX) doesn't support variable interpolation inside an attribute value. The below representation won't work:

```jsx
<img className="image" src="images/{this.props.image}" />
```

But you can put any JS expression inside curly braces as the entire attribute value. So the below expression works:

```jsx
<img className="image" src={'images/' + this.props.image} />
```

Using _template strings_ will also work:

```jsx
<img className="image" src={`images/${this.props.image}`} />
```
