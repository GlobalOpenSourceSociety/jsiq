### What is Concurrent Rendering?

The Concurrent rendering makes React apps to be more responsive by rendering component trees without blocking the main UI thread. It allows React to interrupt a long-running render to handle a high-priority event. i.e, When you enabled concurrent Mode, React will keep an eye on other tasks that need to be done, and if there's something with a higher priority it will pause what it is currently rendering and let the other task finish first. You can enable this in two ways,

```javascript
// 1. Part of an app by wrapping with ConcurrentMode
<React.unstable_ConcurrentMode>
  <Something />
</React.unstable_ConcurrentMode>;

// 2. Whole app using createRoot
ReactDOM.unstable_createRoot(domNode).render(<App />);
```
