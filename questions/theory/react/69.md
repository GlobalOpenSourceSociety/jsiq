### How you use decorators in React?

You can _decorate_ your _class_ components, which is the same as passing the component into a function. **Decorators** are flexible and readable way of modifying component functionality.

```jsx
@setTitle('Profile')
class Profile extends React.Component {
  //....
}

/*
title is a string that will be set as a document title
WrappedComponent is what our decorator will receive when
put directly above a component class as seen in the example above
*/
const setTitle = (title) => (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      document.title = title;
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
};
```

**Note:** Decorators are a feature that didn't make it into ES7, but are currently a _stage 2 proposal_.
