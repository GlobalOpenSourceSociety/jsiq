# How to use TypeScript in `create-react-app` application?

Starting from react-scripts@2.1.0 or higher, there is a built-in support for typescript. i.e, `create-react-app` now supports typescript natively. You can just pass `--typescript` option as below

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --typescript

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --typescript
```

But for lower versions of react scripts, just supply `--scripts-version` option as `react-scripts-ts` while you create a new project. `react-scripts-ts` is a set of adjustments to take the standard `create-react-app` project pipeline and bring TypeScript into the mix.

Now the project layout should look like the following:

```
my-app/
├─ .gitignore
├─ images.d.ts
├─ node_modules/
├─ public/
├─ src/
│  └─ ...
├─ package.json
├─ tsconfig.json
├─ tsconfig.prod.json
├─ tsconfig.test.json
└─ tslint.json
```

# What are the main features of Reselect library?

Let's see the main features of Reselect library,

1. Selectors can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
2. Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.
3. Selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.

## Give an example of Reselect usage?

Let's take calculations and different amounts of a shipment order with the simplified usage of Reselect:

```javascript
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

const shopItemsSelector = (state) => state.shop.items;
const taxPercentSelector = (state) => state.shop.taxPercent;

const subtotalSelector = createSelector(shopItemsSelector, (items) =>
  items.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0),
);

const taxSelector = createSelector(
  subtotalSelector,
  taxPercentSelector,
  (subtotal, taxPercent) => subtotal * (taxPercent / 100),
);

export const totalSelector = createSelector(subtotalSelector, taxSelector, (subtotal, tax) => ({
  total: subtotal + tax,
}));

let exampleState = {
  shop: {
    taxPercent: 8,
    items: [
      { name: 'apple', value: 1.2 },
      { name: 'orange', value: 0.95 },
    ],
  },
};

console.log(subtotalSelector(exampleState)); // 2.15
console.log(taxSelector(exampleState)); // 0.172
console.log(totalSelector(exampleState)); // { total: 2.322 }
```
