### How to write comments in React?

The comments in React/JSX are similar to JavaScript Multiline comments but are wrapped in curly braces.

**Single-line comments:**

```jsx
<div>
  {/* Single-line comments(In vanilla JavaScript, the single-line comments are represented by double slash(//)) */}
  {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}
</div>
```

**Multi-line comments:**

```jsx
<div>
  {/* Multi-line comments for more than
  one line */}
  {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}
</div>
```
