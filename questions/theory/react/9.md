### What are props in React?

_Props_ are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.

The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:

1. Pass custom data to your component.
2. Trigger state changes.
3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method.

For example, let us create an element with `reactProp` property:

```jsx
<Element reactProp={'1'} />
```

This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.

```
props.reactProp
```
