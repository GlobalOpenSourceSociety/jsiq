### Why React uses `className` over `class` attribute?

`class` is a keyword in JavaScript, and JSX is an extension of JavaScript. That's the principal reason why React uses `className` instead of `class`. Pass a string as the `className` prop.

```jsx
render() {
return <span className={'menu navigation-menu'}>{'Menu'}</span>
}
```
