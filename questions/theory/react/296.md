# Why do we use array destructuring (square brackets notation) in `useState`?

When we declare a state variable with `useState`, it returns a pair â€” an array with two items. The first item is the current value, and the second is a function that updates the value. Using [0] and [1] to access them is a bit confusing because they have a specific meaning. This is why we use array destructuring instead.

For example, the array index access would look as follows:

```javascript
var userStateVariable = useState('userProfile'); // Returns an array pair
var user = userStateVariable[0]; // Access first item
var setUser = userStateVariable[1]; // Access second item
```

Whereas with array destructuring the variables can be accessed as follows:

```javascript
const [user, setUser] = useState('userProfile');
```
