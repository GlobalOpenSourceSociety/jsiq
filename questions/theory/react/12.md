### What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of `setState()`?

The callback function is invoked when setState finished and the component gets rendered. Since `setState()` is **asynchronous** the callback function is used for any post action.

**Note:** It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather than this callback function.

```javascript
setState({ name: 'John' }, () => console.log('The name has updated and component re-rendered'));
```
