# What are the differences between `call()` and `put()` in redux-saga?

Both `call()` and `put()` are effect creator functions. `call()` function is used to create effect description, which instructs middleware to call the promise. `put()` function creates an effect, which instructs middleware to dispatch an action to the store.

Let's take example of how these effects work for fetching particular user data.

```javascript
function* fetchUserSaga(action) {
  // `call` function accepts rest arguments, which will be passed to `api.fetchUser` function.
  // Instructing middleware to call promise, it resolved value will be assigned to `userData` variable
  const userData = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.userId);

  // Instructing middleware to dispatch corresponding action.
  yield put({
    type: 'FETCH_USER_SUCCESS',
    userData,
  });
}
```
