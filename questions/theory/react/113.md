### How to add Google Analytics for React Router?

Add a listener on the `history` object to record each page view:

```javascript
history.listen(function (location) {
  window.ga('set', 'page', location.pathname + location.search);
  window.ga('send', 'pageview', location.pathname + location.search);
});
```
