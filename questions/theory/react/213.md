### How to prevent unnecessary updates using setState?

You can compare current value of the state with an existing state value and decide whether to rerender the page or not. If the values are same then you need to return **null** to stop re-rendering otherwise return the latest state value.

For example, the user profile information is conditionally rendered as follows,

```jsx
getUserProfile = (user) => {
  const latestAddress = user.address;
  this.setState((state) => {
    if (state.address === latestAddress) {
      return null;
    } else {
      return { title: latestAddress };
    }
  });
};
```
