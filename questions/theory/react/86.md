### What are the Pointer Events supported in React?

_Pointer Events_ provide a unified way of handling all input events. In the old days we had a mouse and respective event listeners to handle them but nowadays we have many devices which don't correlate to having a mouse, like phones with touch surface or pens. We need to remember that these events will only work in browsers that support the _Pointer Events_ specification.

The following event types are now available in _React DOM_:

1. `onPointerDown`
2. `onPointerMove`
3. `onPointerUp`
4. `onPointerCancel`
5. `onGotPointerCapture`
6. `onLostPointerCapture`
7. `onPointerEnter`
8. `onPointerLeave`
9. `onPointerOver`
10. `onPointerOut`
