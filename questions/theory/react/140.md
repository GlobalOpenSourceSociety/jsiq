### How to access current locale with React Intl?

You can get the current locale in any component of your application using `injectIntl()`:

```jsx
import { injectIntl, intlShape } from 'react-intl';

const MyComponent = ({ intl }) => <div>{`The current locale is ${intl.locale}`}</div>;

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  intl: intlShape.isRequired,
};

export default injectIntl(MyComponent);
```
