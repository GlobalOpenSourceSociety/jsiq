# Why does it return `false` when comparing two similar objects in JavaScript?

Suppose we have an example below.

```javascript
let a = { a: 1 };
let b = { a: 1 };
let c = a;

console.log(a === b); // logs false even though they have the same property
console.log(a === c); // logs true hmm
```

**JavaScript** compares _objects_ and _primitives_ differently. In _primitives_ it compares them by **value** while in _objects_ it compares them by **reference** or the **address in memory where the variable is stored**. That's why the first `console.log` statement returns `false` and the second `console.log` statement returns `true`. `a` and `c` have the same reference and `a` and `b` are not.
