# What's the value of `this` in JavaScript?

Basically, `this` refers to the value of the object that is currently executing or invoking the function. I say `currently` due to the reason that the value of this changes depending on the context on which we use it and where we use it.

```javascript
const carDetails = {
  name: 'Ford Mustang',
  yearBought: 2005,
  getName() {
    return this.name;
  },
  isRegistered: true,
};

console.log(carDetails.getName()); // logs Ford Mustang
```

This is what we would normally expect because in the **getName** method we return `this.name`, `this` in this context refers to the object which is the carDetails object that is currently the "owner" object of the function executing.

Ok, Let's some add some code to make it weird. Below the `console.log` statement add this three lines of code

```javascript
var name = 'Ford Ranger';
var getCarName = carDetails.getName;

console.log(getCarName()); // logs Ford Ranger
```

The second `console.log` statement prints the word **Ford Ranger** which is weird because in our first `console.log` statement it printed Ford Mustang. The reason to this is that the `getCarName` method has a different "owner" object that is the `window` object. Declaring variables with the `var` keyword in the global scope attaches properties in the `window` object with the same name as the variables. Remember `this` in the global scope refers to the `window` object when `"use strict"` is not used.

```javascript
console.log(getCarName === window.getCarName); //logs true
console.log(getCarName === this.getCarName); // logs true
```

`this` and `window` in this example refer to the same object.

One way of solving this problem is by using the apply and call methods in functions.

```javascript
console.log(getCarName.apply(carDetails)); //logs Ford Mustang
console.log(getCarName.call(carDetails)); //logs Ford Mustang
```

The `apply` and `call` methods expects the first parameter to be an object which would be value of this inside that function.

**IIFE** or **Immediately Invoked Function Expression**, Functions that are declared in the global scope, **Anonymous Functions** and Inner functions in methods inside an object has a default of `this` which points to the `window` object.

```javascript
(function () {
  console.log(this);
})(); //logs the "window" object

function iHateThis() {
  console.log(this);
}

iHateThis(); //logs the "window" object

const myFavoriteObj = {
  guessThis() {
    function getThis() {
      console.log(this);
    }
    getThis();
  },
  name: 'Marko Polo',
  thisIsAnnoying(callback) {
    callback();
  },
};

myFavoriteObj.guessThis(); //logs the "window" object
myFavoriteObj.thisIsAnnoying(function () {
  console.log(this); //logs the "window" object
});
```

If we want to get the value of the `name` property which is **Marko Polo** in the `myFavoriteObj` object there are two ways to solve this.

First, we save the value of `this` in a variable.

```javascript
const myFavoriteObj = {
  guessThis() {
    const self = this; //saves the this value to the "self" variable
    function getName() {
      console.log(self.name);
    }
    getName();
  },
  name: 'Marko Polo',
  thisIsAnnoying(callback) {
    callback();
  },
};
```

In this image we save the value of this which would be the myFavoriteObj object. So we can access it inside the getName inner function.

Second, we use ES6 Arrow Functions.

```javascript
const myFavoriteObj = {
  guessThis() {
    const getName = () => {
      //copies the value of "this" outside of this arrow function
      console.log(this.name);
    };
    getName();
  },
  name: 'Marko Polo',
  thisIsAnnoying(callback) {
    callback();
  },
};
```

Arrow Functions does not have its own `this`. It copies the value of `this` of the enclosing lexical scope or in `this` example the value of this outside the `getName` inner function which would be the `myFavoriteObj` object. We can also determine the value of `this` on how the function is invoked.
