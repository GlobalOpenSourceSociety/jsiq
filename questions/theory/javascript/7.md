# What is **Event Propagation**?
When an `event` occurs on a `DOM` element, that `event` does not entirely occur on that just one element. In the **Bubbling Phase**, the event bubbles up or it goes to its parent, to its grandparents, to its grandparent's parent until it reaches all the way to the window while in the **Capturing Phase** the event starts from the window down to the element that triggered the event or the event.target.

#### Event Propagation has three phases.

- [Capturing Phase](what-is-event-capturing) – the event starts from window then goes down to every element until it reaches the target element.
- [Target Phase](what-is-event-target) – the event has reached the target element.
- [Bubbling Phase](what-is-event-bubbling) – the event bubbles up from the target element then goes up every element until it reaches the window.
