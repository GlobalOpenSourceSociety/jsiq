# What's the difference between `event.preventDefault()` and `event.stopPropagation()` methods?

The `event.preventDefault()` method prevents the default behavior of an element. If used in a form element it prevents it from submitting. If used in an anchor element it prevents it from navigating. If used in a contextmenu it prevents it from showing or displaying. While the `event.stopPropagation()` method stops the propagation of an event or it stops the event from occurring in the [bubbling](what-is-event-bubbling) or [capturing](what-is-event-capturing) phase.
