# Why does this code `obj.someprop.x` throw an error?

Obviously, this throws an error due to the reason we are trying to access a
`x` property in the `someprop` property which have an `undefined` value. Remember **properties** in an object which does not exist in itself and its **prototype** has a default value of `undefined` and `undefined` has no property x.
