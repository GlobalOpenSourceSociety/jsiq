# What does `use strict` do?

`use strict` is a ES5 feature in **JavaScript** that makes our code in **Strict Mode** in functions or entire scripts. Strict Mode helps us avoid bugs early on in our code and adds restrictions to it.

Restrictions that Strict Mode gives us.

- Assigning or Accessing a variable that is not declared.

```javascript
function returnY() {
  'use strict';
  y = 123;
  return y;
}
```

- Assigning a value to a read-only or non-writable global variable;

```javascript
'use strict';
var NaN = NaN;
var undefined = undefined;
var Infinity = 'and beyond';
```

- Deleting an undeletable property.

```javascript
'use strict';
const obj = {};

Object.defineProperty(obj, 'x', {
  value: '1',
});

delete obj.x;
```

- Duplicate parameter names.

```javascript
'use strict';

function someFunc(a, b, b, c) {}
```

- Creating variables with the use of the eval function.

```javascript
'use strict';

eval('var x = 1;');

console.log(x); //Throws a Reference Error x is not defined
```

- The default value of this will be `undefined`.

```javascript
'use strict';

function showMeThis() {
  return this;
}

showMeThis(); //returns undefined
```

There are many more restrictions in Strict Mode than these.
