# What is the DOM?

**DOM** stands for **Document Object Model** is an interface (`API`) for HTML and XML documents. When the browser first reads (parses) our HTML document it creates a big object, a really big object based on the HTML document this is the **DOM**. It is a tree-like structure that is modeled from the HTML document. The **DOM** is used for interacting and modifying the **DOM** structure or specific Elements or Nodes.

Imagine if we have an HTML structure like this.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
   <title>Document Object Model</title>
</head>

<body>
   <div>
      <p>
         <span></span>
      </p>
      <label></label>
      <input>
   </div>
</body>

</html>
```

The **DOM** equivalent would be like this.

The `document` object in **JavaScript** represents the **DOM**. It provides us many methods that we can use to selecting elements to update element contents and many more.
