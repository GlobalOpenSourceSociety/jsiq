# Why are functions called First-class Objects?

`Functions` in JavaScript are **First-class Objects** because they are treated as any other value in the language. 

They can be assigned to **variables**, they can be **properties of an object** which are called **methods**, they can be an **item in array**, they can be **passed as arguments to a function**, and they can be **returned as values of a function**. 

The only difference between a function and any other value in **JavaScript** is that **functions** can be invoked or called.
