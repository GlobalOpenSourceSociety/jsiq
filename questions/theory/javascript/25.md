# What is the `prototype` of an object?

A `prototype` in simplest terms is a _blueprint_ of an object. It is used as a fallback for **properties** and **methods** if it does exist in the current object. It's the way to share properties and functionality between objects. It's the core concept around JavaScript's **Prototypal Inheritance**.

```javascript
const o = {};
console.log(o.toString()); // logs [object Object]
```

Even though the `o.toString` method does not exist in the `o` object it does not throw an error instead returns a string `[object Object]`. When a property does not exist in the object it looks into its **prototype** and if it still does not exist it looks into the **prototype's prototype** and so on until it finds a property with the same in the **Prototype Chain**. The end of the Prototype Chain is the Object.prototype.

```javascript
console.log(o.toString === Object.prototype.toString); // logs true
// which means we we're looking up the Prototype Chain and it reached
// the Object.prototype and used the "toString" method.
```
