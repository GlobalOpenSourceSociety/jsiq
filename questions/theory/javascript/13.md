# What is **event.target**?

In simplest terms, the event.target is the element on which the event occurred or the element that triggered the event.

Sample HTML Markup.

```html
<div onclick="clickFunc(event)">
  <div>
    <div>
      <button>Button</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Sample JavaScript.

```javascript
function clickFunc(event) {
  console.log(event.target);
}
```

If you click the **button** it will log the button markup even though we attach the event on the outermost div it will always log the button so we can conclude that the `event.target` is the element that triggered the event.
