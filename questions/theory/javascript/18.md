# How to evaluate multiple expressions in one line?

We can use the `,` or comma operator to evaluate multiple expressions in one line. It evaluates from left-to-right and returns the value of the last item on the right or the last operand.

```javascript
let x = 5;

x = (x++ , x = addFive(x), x *= 2, x -= 5, x += 10);

function addFive(num) {
  return num + 5;
}
```

If you log the value of `x` it would be **27**. 
First, we increment the value of `x` it would be **6**, then we invoke the function `addFive(6)` and pass the 6 as a parameter and assign the result to x the new value of x would be 11. 
After that, we multiply the current value of `x` to 2 and assign it to `x` the updated value of `x` would be **22**. 
Then, we subtract the current value of `x` to 5 and assign the result to `x` the updated value would be **17**. 
And lastly, we increment the value of `x` by 10 and assign the updated value to `x` now the value of `x` would be **27**.
