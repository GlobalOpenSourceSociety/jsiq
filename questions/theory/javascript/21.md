# What are Closures?

This is probably the hardest question of all these questions because **Closures** is a controversial topic. So I'm gonna explain it from what I understand.

**Closures** is simply the ability of a function at the time of declaration to remember the references of variables and parameters on its current scope, on its parent function scope, on its parent's parent function scope until it reaches the global scope with the help of Scope Chain. Basically it is the Scope created when the function was declared.

Examples are a great way to explain closures.

```javascript
//Global's Scope
var globalVar = 'abc';

function a() {
  //testClosures's Scope
  console.log(globalVar);
}

a(); //logs "abc"
/* Scope Chain
   Inside a function perspective
   a's scope -> global's scope  
*/
```

In this example, when we declare the `a` function the Global Scope is part of `a`'s closure.

The reason for the variable `globalVar` which does not have a value in the image because of the reason that the value of that variable can change based on where and when we invoke the `a` function. But in our example above the `globalVar` variable will have the value of abc.

Ok, let's have a complex example.

```javascript
var globalVar = 'global';
var outerVar = 'outer';

function outerFunc(outerParam) {
  function innerFunc(innerParam) {
    console.log(globalVar, outerParam, innerParam);
  }
  return innerFunc;
}

const x = outerFunc(outerVar);
outerVar = 'outer-2';
globalVar = 'guess';
x('inner');
```

![Javascript Closure example 2](/questions/javascript/21/21-2.jpg)

This will print **"guess outer inner"**. 
The explanation for this is that when we invoke the `outerFunc` function and assigned the returned value the `innerFunc` function to the variable `x`. The `outerParam` will have a value of outer even though we assign a new value `outer-2` to the `outerVar` variable because the reassignment happened after the invocation of the outer function and in that time when we invoke the outerFunc function it's look up the value of outerVar in the Scope Chain, the `outerVar` will have a value of **"outer"**. 
Now, when we invoke the `x` variable which have a reference to the `innerFunc`. The `innerParam` will have a value of **inner** because thats the value we pass in the invocation and the globalVar variable will have a value of guess because before the invocation of the x variable we assign a new value to the globalVar and at the time of invocation x the value of globalVar in the Scope Chain is guess.

We have an example that demonstrates a problem of not understanding closure correctly.

```javascript
const arrFuncs = [];
for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
  arrFuncs.push(function (){
    return i;
  });
}
console.log(i); // i is 5

for (let i = 0; i < arrFuncs.length; i++) {
  console.log(arrFuncs[i]()); // all logs "5"
}
```

This code is not working as we expected because of **Closures**.
The `var` keyword makes a global variable and when we push a function
we return the global variable `i`. So when we call one of those functions in that array after the loop it logs `5` because we get the current value of `i` which is `5` and we can access it because it's a global variable. Because Closures keeps the references of that variable not its values at the time of it's creation. 
We can solve this using IIFES or changing the `var` keyword to `let` for block-scoping.
